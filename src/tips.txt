# Advice
Working with physical media during your show means you get to really rock the faders and mix in songs into your set versus the few seconds delay that comes with digital playlists/streaming.
The walls of CDs and the shelves of CDs in the lounge are a treasure trove of 90s-early 00s sounds and worth a spin or two.
Wear headphones when talking! Make sure that you can hear yourself loud and clear.
Fade in and out when transitioning between audio sources. It makes you feel like a ~real DJ~ and definitely more professional from the listeners perspective.
Listen to other DJs shows as you get exposed to new sounds and can comment on how great they are doing via our GroupMe!
