Advice:
Go in with a plan, even on your chill days!
Working with actual media during your show means you get to really rock the faders and get to really mix in songs into your set versus the few seconds delay that comes with digital playlists/streams.
The walls of CDs and the shelves of CDs in the lounge are a treasure trove of 90s-early 00s sounds and worth a spin or two.
Use headphones when talking!
Experiment with crossfade (in your Spotify settings, if that's your thing).
Fade in and out when transitioning between audio sources. It makes uyou feel like a ~real DJ~ and definitely more professional from the listeners perspective.
Listen to other DJs shows as you get exposed to new sounds and can comment on how great they are doing via our GroupMe!
Install, pin, and use the WBOR Chrome extension!
